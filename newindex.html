I focused on typography as a main style element of this blog to test my abilities and learn a new technique. My final product includes an interactive and responsive fashion blog with a simple layout and color palette.

                        My group and I focused on redesigning the interfaces of the Septa kiosk, scanner, and phone app, along with the experience users have while interacting with it. Through research, we discovered that users were making errors due to inefficient signifiers that did not delineate clear functions or calls to action. Our solution involved addressing confusing language, clarifying icons and symbols, and reducing the number of clicks while maintaining a simple design.
